The app displays the contacts from a set of data in a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to find and access the information they need. The user is able to delete contacts that they no longer need. They can also sort their contacts by city, which helps them quickly identify contacts based on their location.

This was a project I completed during my time at Thinkful and I decided to take it a step farther to allow the user to choose their desired background color.
